📍 Step 1: Choose the Target Project
A well-known project is MaxHalford/chime — a Python library that plays notification sounds on command-line events (like success, error, warning).

You can also contribute to forks or spin-off projects that use Chime in larger CLI or automation tools.

🔍 Step 2: Assess Current Contributions
Go to:
GitHub → Insights → Contributors

Look at current contributors and their commit counts.

Choose a contributor (you or a teammate) with fewer than 100 commits and aim to build from there.

🧠 Step 3: Plan Regular Contributions
To reach 100 commits, break it down like this:

2–3 commits per week for 10–15 weeks.

Here are example contribution types:

Area	Examples
🐞 Bug Fixes	Platform-specific issues (e.g., Mac sound issues)
🎨 New Features	CLI flags, volume control, theme previews
🔊 New Themes	Add .wav sounds (e.g., Mario, Zelda, anime, alerts)
🧪 Tests & CI	Add cross-platform tests, GitHub Actions, Windows/macOS checks
📄 Documentation	Improve README, write usage examples, update changelogs

📝 Step 4: Assign Issues and Tasks
Break your goals into GitHub Issues so you can track them clearly. Examples:

"Add --theme list option to CLI"

"Improve Windows compatibility for warning sound"

"Add GitHub Actions to run tests on Ubuntu & macOS"

"Add 3 new .wav themes to sound library"

This also helps others join and keeps commits focused.

🔁 Step 5: Make and Review Pull Requests
Each pull request:

Should be small and focused

Can contain 1–5 commits

Should include relevant unit tests (if applicable)

Should follow style and code standards

Regular PR reviews and merges will steadily increase your commit count.
